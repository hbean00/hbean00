## About Me

- Electrical Engineering @ Korea University
- GPA: 4.41 / 4.5
- Interested in:
  - Memory subsystem architecture
  - Data movement optimization
  - Processing-in-Memory (PIM)
  - SoC system design

My current research focuses on enhancing PIM capability to reduce data round-trip overhead in heterogeneous PIM-CPU systems by moving previously CPU-dependent operations closer to memory.
